Hi! I'm Fredi, a software engineer @Westpac, based in Gold Coast, Australia.

I'm very passionate about building and delivering great software applications using .NET and Azure.

I'm writing C# code most of the time, building Web applications in Visual Studio/VS Code.
In my spare time you'll find me playing electric guitar, tennis with my wife or cooking Brazillian barbecue.

All the opinions shared on my website, twitter, YouTube videos, streams, etc, are my own and not necessarily those of my employer.
