Hi! I'm Fredi, a software developer @WooliesX, based in Gold Coast, Australia.

I'm very passionate about building and delivering great software applications using bleeding edge technology,
well known practices/techniques and frameworks available.

I'm a .NET guy and I'm writing C# code most of the time, building websites and applications
in .NET, .NET Core and Visual Studio/VS Code. I also consider myself to be a gamer, electronics geek, guitarist/drummer, fascinated by technology and astronomy.

All the opinions shared on my website, twitter, YouTube videos, streams, etc, are my own and not necessarily those of my employer.
